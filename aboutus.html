        	<p class="hvemErVi1">Our media habits are changing; we have all become digital natives. We have changed, and that means we have to do things differently if we are to get our message out there. The job has got more complex for marketing people, and good insight into user behaviour and technology, with an understanding of new media habits, is crucial.</p>
            
            <p class="hvemErVi2">We are a local marketing company in the city of Halden who offers marketing solution all over the world. We deliver small offers like big offers, now we have 3 employees who have a lot of experience and knowledge in the marketing world. </p>
            
            <p class="hvemErVi3">The traditional advertisement no longer exists â€“ but the tradition of good advertisements lives on in the best of health. A clear message presented in a creative and engaging manner will always be the basis of a good advertisement. But we must have the confidence of consumers, and a survey conducted by Nielsen shows that big changes are afoot. When consumers were asked who they trusted, the answer was sensational.</p>
            
             <p class="hvemErVi3">Only 37% trust what an advertisement says (and here the trend was downwards), 57% trust what they read on your website, 80% trust what they themselves read in social media, while as many as 97% trust information from their own friends in social media. Hyper works multi-directionally to make sure your story is credible, engaging and gets out there, often as a combination of film, ads, social media, own channels and in many cases, using games.</p>
